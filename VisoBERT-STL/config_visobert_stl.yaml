# Sequential Single-Task Learning Configuration for ABSA
# ========================================================================
# Two-stage training approach:
#   Stage 1 (AD): Aspect Detection - Binary classification for 11 aspects (includes Others)
#   Stage 2 (SC): Sentiment Classification - 3-class for 10 aspects (excludes Others)
# 
# Base Model: 5CD-AI/visobert-14gb-corpus
# - General Vietnamese language model (pretrained on ~14GB corpus)
# - Stage 1: 11 binary outputs (aspect mentioned or not, including Others)
# - Stage 2: 10 × 3 multi-class outputs (positive/negative/neutral per aspect, excluding Others)
# - Note: "Others" is detected in AD stage but excluded from SC stage (no sentiment labels)

# REPRODUCIBILITY: Master Seed Configuration
# ========================================================================
# All random operations use seeds derived from master_seed for consistency
# Change master_seed to run different experiments (e.g., 42, 123, 456, 789, 2024)
# ========================================================================
reproducibility:
  # Data preprocessing seeds
  data_split_seed: 42              # Seed for train/val/test split
  oversampling_seed: 42            # Seed for aspect-wise oversampling
  shuffle_seed: 42               # Seed for data shuffling
  
  # Model training seeds
  training_seed: 100                # Seed for PyTorch/Transformers training
  # Note: dataloader_seed removed - only training_seed is used for reproducibility
  
  # Notes:
  # - All seeds set to 42 by default for reproducibility
  # - For multiple runs, change master_seed: [42, 123, 456, 789, 2024]
  # - Recommended: Keep all seeds = master_seed unless specific reason
