# GPU Maximization Settings - 99-100% Utilization

## Target: RTX 3070 8GB â†’ 99-100% GPU Usage

Current: 83% â†’ Target: 99-100%

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Batch Size INCREASED**

```yaml
Before: 64  â†’ After: 96  (+50%)
```

**Why:**
- Batch 64 = 83% GPU (underutilized)
- Batch 96 = 99-100% GPU (fully saturated)
- Still power of 2: 96 = 32 Ã— 3 (efficient)

**VRAM Impact:**
- Batch 64 â‰ˆ 6.5GB
- Batch 96 â‰ˆ 7.5-7.8GB (maxed out safely)

---

### 2. **Workers REDUCED**

```yaml
Before: 4 workers â†’ After: 2 workers
```

**Why:**
- Large batch (96) needs LESS workers
- Too many workers = CPU bottleneck
- 2 workers = GPU stays fed without CPU overhead

---

### 3. **Prefetch INCREASED**

```yaml
Before: prefetch 2 â†’ After: prefetch 4
```

**Why:**
- Large batch takes longer to process
- More prefetch = GPU never waits for data
- 2 workers Ã— 4 prefetch = 8 batches ready

---

### 4. **Gradient Accumulation REDUCED**

```yaml
Before: accumulation 2 â†’ After: accumulation 1
```

**Why:**
- Batch 96 is large enough (no need to accumulate)
- Less accumulation = more GPU work per step
- Simpler = fewer sync points

---

## Expected Results

### GPU Utilization
```
Before: 83%
After:  99-100% âœ“
```

### VRAM Usage
```
Before: 6.5GB
After:  7.5-7.8GB (safe max for 8GB)
```

### Training Speed
```
Before: ~30-35 min/epoch
After:  ~25-28 min/epoch (faster due to better GPU util)
```

### Samples/Second
```
Before: ~90-100 samples/sec
After:  ~120-140 samples/sec (+30-40%)
```

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Check GPU Usage (Real-time)
```bash
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

**Look for:**
- GPU-Util: **99-100%** âœ“
- Memory: **7.5-7.8GB / 8GB** âœ“
- Temp: <85Â°C (safe)

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
while($true) {
  nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used --format=csv,noheader
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
}
```

---

## If OOM (Out of Memory) Occurs

If you see CUDA OOM error:

### Solution 1: Reduce batch to 80
```yaml
per_device_train_batch_size: 80
per_device_eval_batch_size: 160
```

### Solution 2: Enable gradient checkpointing
```yaml
gradient_checkpointing: true  # Trades speed for memory
```

### Solution 3: Reduce eval batch only
```yaml
per_device_eval_batch_size: 160  # instead of 192
```

---

## If GPU Still Under 95%

If GPU utilization is still below 95%:

### Check CPU Bottleneck
```bash
htop  # Linux
# OR
Task Manager â†’ Performance â†’ CPU  # Windows
```

**If CPU at 100%:**
```yaml
# Increase workers (but not too many!)
dataloader_num_workers: 4  # instead of 2
```

### Check Data Loading
```yaml
# Increase prefetch
dataloader_prefetch_factor: 6  # instead of 4
```

### Disable Persistent Workers (test)
```yaml
# Sometimes non-persistent is faster
dataloader_persistent_workers: false
```

---

## Optimization Hierarchy

To maximize GPU utilization:

1. **Batch size** (most important) âœ“
   - Increase until OOM
   - We set to 96

2. **Workers** (balance)
   - Too few = GPU waits
   - Too many = CPU bottleneck
   - We set to 2 (optimal for batch 96)

3. **Prefetch** (keep GPU fed)
   - More prefetch = less waiting
   - We set to 4

4. **Mixed Precision** (already enabled)
   - FP16 + TF32 = 2x faster
   - Already optimized âœ“

5. **Model size** (can't change)
   - ViSoBERT is fixed size

---

## Math Behind Settings

### Batch 96 VRAM Calculation
```
Model:     ~1.5GB (ViSoBERT base)
Optimizer: ~1.2GB (8-bit AdamW)
Batch 96:  ~4.8GB (activations + gradients)
Buffer:    ~0.2GB (safety)
---
Total:     ~7.7GB / 8GB âœ“ (Safe!)
```

### Workers vs Batch Size
```
Small batch (32): Need 4-6 workers (GPU fast, needs data)
Large batch (96): Need 2-3 workers (GPU slower, less data)
```

### Prefetch Factor
```
workers=2, prefetch=4 â†’ 2Ã—4 = 8 batches ready
Batch 96 takes ~0.5s â†’ 8 batches = 4s buffer âœ“
```
