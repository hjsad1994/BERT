ALPHA WEIGHTS FIX COMPLETE - READY TO TRAIN!
================================================================================

BUG FOUND AND FIXED:
  - Alpha weights were calculated from ORIGINAL data
  - But training uses BALANCED data
  - This mismatch causes suboptimal training!

FIX APPLIED:
  File: VisoBERT-STL/train_visobert_stl.py
  Line: ~676
  Change: config['paths']['train_file'] -> train_file_sc
  Result: Alpha now calculated from SAME data used for training

================================================================================
ALPHA WEIGHTS COMPARISON
================================================================================

Sentiment    OLD (Original)   NEW (Balanced)   Change
-------------------------------------------------------
Positive     0.5943           0.9764          +64.3%
Negative     0.9252           0.8686          -6.1%
Neutral      4.2323 (!)       1.2128          -71.3% (!)

KEY INSIGHT:
  OLD: Neutral weight = 4.23 (treats as 7.88% of data)
  NEW: Neutral weight = 1.21 (treats as 27.48% of data)
  
  Result: More balanced training, better generalization!

================================================================================
EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS AFTER FIX
================================================================================

With correct alpha weights:
  - Recall: +1-2% improvement (better class balance)
  - Precision: +0.5-1% improvement (less Neutral bias)
  - F1: +1-2% overall improvement

Target Results:
  - F1: ~94.5-95% (vs ~93-94% with wrong alpha)
  - Recall: ~94-95% (vs ~92-93% with wrong alpha)
  - Precision: ~94.5% (maintained or improved)

================================================================================
HOW TO RE-RUN TRAINING
================================================================================

Step 1: Navigate to directory
  cd E:\BERT\VisoBERT-STL

Step 2: Start training with CORRECT alpha weights
  python train_visobert_stl.py --config config_visobert_stl.yaml

Expected training time: ~50-67 minutes (15 epochs with early stopping)

================================================================================
WHAT TO MONITOR
================================================================================

During training, watch for:
  1. Validation metrics should improve faster
  2. Neutral class precision/recall should be more balanced
  3. Overall convergence should be smoother

After training, check:
  - results/two_stage_training/final_report.txt
  - models/sentiment_classification/recall_errors_all_samples.txt
  - Compare per-aspect metrics, especially Neutral performance
