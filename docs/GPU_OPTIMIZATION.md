# GPU Optimization Applied

## Problem
GPU utilization only 85% ‚Üí wasting GPU resources

## Solution: Maximize GPU Usage

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Increased Batch Size** üî•
```yaml
# BEFORE:
per_device_train_batch_size: 32
per_device_eval_batch_size: 64
gradient_accumulation_steps: 3

# AFTER:
per_device_train_batch_size: 48  # +50% increase!
per_device_eval_batch_size: 96   # +50% increase!
gradient_accumulation_steps: 2   # Adjusted to keep effective batch = 96
```

**Impact:**
- Larger batch ‚Üí More GPU compute per step
- GPU utilization: 85% ‚Üí **95%+**
- Training speed: **~15-20% faster**

---

#### 2. **Reduced DataLoader Workers**
```yaml
# BEFORE:
dataloader_num_workers: 6
dataloader_prefetch_factor: 4

# AFTER:
dataloader_num_workers: 4  # Less CPU overhead
dataloader_prefetch_factor: 2  # Less memory, GPU waits less
```

**Why:**
- Too many workers = CPU bottleneck
- Less workers = More focus on GPU
- Prefetch 2 is enough for fast data loading

---

#### 3. **Enabled TF32** ‚ö°
```yaml
# ADDED:
tf32: true  # Tensor Float 32 for Ampere GPUs
```

**What is TF32:**
- RTX 3070 = Ampere architecture
- TF32 = Special precision mode for matrix ops
- **1.5x faster** matrix multiplications
- No accuracy loss!

## Expected Results

### Training Speed:
```
BEFORE: ~40-45 minutes
AFTER:  ~30-35 minutes  (25-30% faster!)
```

### GPU Utilization:
```
BEFORE: ~85%
AFTER:  ~95%+  (optimal!)
```

### Memory Usage:
```
Batch 32: ~7.0GB VRAM
Batch 48: ~7.8GB VRAM (still safe with 8GB)
```

### F1 Score:
```
Same: 91-92%
(Batch size doesn't affect final accuracy)
```

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Larger Batches = Better GPU Utilization
```
Small batch (32):
  - GPU waits for data
  - Underutilized cores
  - 85% usage

Large batch (48):
  - GPU always busy
  - Full core utilization
  - 95%+ usage
```

### 2. Less CPU Overhead
```
6 workers:
  - More CPU time spawning workers
  - Memory overhead
  - Context switching

4 workers:
  - Less overhead
  - More efficient
  - GPU gets data faster
```

### 3. TF32 Magic (Ampere GPUs Only)
```
FP32: 32-bit precision
TF32: 19-bit mantissa, 8-bit exp
  - Same range as FP32
  - Faster than FP32
  - More accurate than FP16
  - FREE SPEEDUP on Ampere!
```

## Safety Check

### Will it OOM (Out of Memory)?

**Math:**
```
Model:       ~1.5GB
Batch 32:    ~5.5GB activations
Total:       ~7.0GB (safe)

Batch 48:    ~6.3GB activations  (+0.8GB)
Total:       ~7.8GB (still safe with 8GB VRAM!)
```

### What if OOM happens?

**Fallback options:**
```yaml
# Option 1: Slightly smaller batch
per_device_train_batch_size: 40
gradient_accumulation_steps: 2  # Effective = 80

# Option 2: Enable gradient checkpointing (saves VRAM)
gradient_checkpointing: true  # Trades speed for memory
```

---

## Monitoring

### During training, watch for:

**Good signs:**
```
‚úì GPU utilization: 95%+
‚úì Training speed: 1.2-1.5 it/s
‚úì VRAM usage: 7.5-7.9GB
‚úì No OOM errors
```

**Bad signs:**
```
‚ùå OOM error ‚Üí Reduce batch size
‚ùå GPU util < 90% ‚Üí Check CPU bottleneck
‚ùå Slow speed < 1.0 it/s ‚Üí Check data loading
```

---

## Commands

### Check GPU usage during training:
```bash
# In another terminal:
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

### If OOM, revert to safe settings:
```bash
# Edit config_optimized.yaml:
per_device_train_batch_size: 40  # or 32
```

## Summary

**3 Key Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Batch size: 32 ‚Üí 48 (50% larger)
2. ‚úÖ Workers: 6 ‚Üí 4 (less overhead)
3. ‚úÖ TF32: enabled (Ampere boost)

**Expected Improvement:**
- GPU util: 85% ‚Üí 95%+
- Speed: 40-45min ‚Üí 30-35min
- Faster by: ~25-30%
