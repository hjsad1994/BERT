## Quick Commands

### 1. Test Implementation (2 min)

```bash
# Test GHM Loss works
cd D:\BERT
python test_ghm_quick.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
GHM-C Loss vs Focal Loss - Quick Test
...
SUMMARY
1. [OK] GHM-C Loss implementation working

3. [OK] Similar or better loss values than Focal
4. [OK] Ready for full training
```

### 2. Train with GHM-C Loss (90 min)

```bash
cd D:\BERT

# Full training (15 epochs)

```

### 3. Compare Results

```bash
# View Focal results (baseline)
type multi_label\models\multilabel_focal_contrastive\test_results_focal_contrastive.json

# View GHM results (new)
type multi_label\models\multilabel_ghm_contrastive\test_results_ghm_contrastive.json

## What is GHM-C Loss?

**GHM-C Loss (Gradient Harmonized Mechanism for Classification)**

### Key Improvements over Focal Loss:

1. **Dynamic Adjustment**
   - Focal: Static weight (gamma=2.0, alpha=class_weights)
   - GHM-C: Adapts based on gradient density during training

2. **Better Sample Handling**
   - Focal: Down-weight easy examples, up-weight hard examples
   - GHM-C: Balance easy, hard, AND outliers automatically

3. **Less Tuning**
   - Focal: Need to tune gamma (1-5) and alpha (class weights)
   - GHM-C: Just set bins (10) and momentum (0.75), works out-of-box

4. **Training Stability**
   - Focal: Can be unstable with extreme imbalance
   - GHM-C: More stable, smoother convergence

### How It Works:

```
1. Forward Pass:
   - Compute predictions
   - Calculate gradient magnitude for each sample

2. Gradient Density:
   - Bin gradients into histogram (e.g., 10 bins)
   - Count samples in each bin
   - Apply momentum smoothing

3. Weight Adjustment:
   - High-density bins (many samples) â†’ Lower weight
   - Low-density bins (few samples) â†’ Higher weight
   - Result: All samples contribute fairly

4. Loss Calculation:
   - loss = CE_loss * (1 / gradient_density)
   - Normalized across batch
```

## Expected Results

### Comparison Table:

| Metric | Focal Loss | GHM-C Loss | Improvement |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Overall F1** | 95.99% | 96.5-97% | +0.5-1.0% |
| **Design (hard)** | 93.21% | 94-95% | +0.8-1.8% |
| **Price (hard)** | 95.84% | 96.5-97% | +0.7-1.2% |
| **Training Speed** | Baseline | +5% slower | Acceptable |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning** | Medium | Minimal | Easier |

### Why GHM-C is Better:

1. **For Hard Aspects** (Design, Price):
   - GHM-C gives more attention to hard examples
   - But doesn't ignore easy examples completely
   - Result: Better balance

2. **For Training Stability**:
   - Less sensitive to hyperparameters
   - Smoother loss curves
   - Fewer sudden spikes

3. **For Production**:
   - Works well even when data distribution changes
   - Less retuning needed
   - More robust

## Configuration

### GHM-C Settings (config_ghm.yaml):

```yaml
multi_label:
  loss_type: "ghm"              # Use GHM-C Loss
  
  # Loss weights
  classification_weight: 0.95   # 95% for GHM-C
  contrastive_weight: 0.05      # 5% for contrastive
  
  # GHM-C parameters
  ghm_bins: 10                  # Gradient bins (5-20)
  ghm_momentum: 0.75            # Smoothing (0.5-0.9)
```

### When to Adjust:

**Increase `ghm_momentum` (0.85) if:**
- Training is unstable
- Loss has many spikes
- Want smoother convergence

**Decrease `ghm_bins` (8) if:**
- Overfitting
- Too slow
- Dataset is small (<10k samples)

**Increase `ghm_bins` (15) if:**
- Underfitting
- Dataset is large (>50k samples)
- Want finer gradient resolution

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: GHM Loss Higher Than Focal

**Symptom:**
```
Epoch 1: GHM Loss = 0.8, Focal Loss = 0.3
```

**Fix:**
```yaml
# Increase momentum for stability
ghm_momentum: 0.85

# Or reduce bins
ghm_bins: 8
```

### Issue 2: Worse F1 Than Focal

**Symptom:**
```
GHM-C F1: 95.5% (vs Focal: 95.99%)
```

**Fix:**
```yaml
# Increase classification weight
classification_weight: 0.97
contrastive_weight: 0.03

# Or switch back to Focal
loss_type: "focal"
```

### Issue 3: Training Too Slow

**Symptom:**
```
GHM: 7 min/epoch (vs Focal: 5 min/epoch)
```

**This is normal (+20-40% slower)**

If too slow:
```yaml
# Reduce bins
ghm_bins: 8

# Or reduce momentum updates
ghm_momentum: 0.9
```

## Next Steps

### After Training:

1. **Check F1 Score:**
   ```bash
   type multi_label\models\multilabel_ghm_contrastive\test_results_ghm_contrastive.json
   ```

2. **Compare with Focal:**
   - If GHM F1 > 96%: Success! Use GHM for production
   - If GHM F1 â‰ˆ 95.9-96%: Both are good, choose based on preference
   - If GHM F1 < 95.5%: Stick with Focal

3. **Analyze Improvements:**
   - Check per-aspect F1 (especially Design, Price)
   - Look at training curves (epoch_losses_*.csv)
   - Verify both losses decreased together

4. **Production Decision:**
   - GHM-C: Better for changing data, less tuning
   - Focal: Simpler, faster training
